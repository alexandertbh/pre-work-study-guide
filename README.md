# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In order to get ready for the UW Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp I wanted to build a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to track and record some of the key concepts I will need for the course. It contains notes on four main sections. HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Open the website and below the title are four sections containing some notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you inspect the page and review the console you will find that the JavaScript has a random function to select one of these subjects from an array and log the response "Let's study (SelectedTopic)!"

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
